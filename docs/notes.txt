Single Layer NN

1. Fixed point representation for floating point values is used, will create a small error compared to floating point.

2. Results for the activation function (sigmoid) will be stored in an On-Chip ROM instead of implementing hardware to calculate the values. ROM will be addressed based on the parameter input for the function.

3. Weights will also be stored in a ROM
